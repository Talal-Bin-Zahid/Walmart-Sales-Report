## 📌 Project Objective

The **Walmart Sales Analysis** project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to evaluate retail sales performance across **45 Walmart stores**. The analysis focuses on understanding how **macroeconomic indicators**—such as **Consumer Price Index (CPI), fuel prices, unemployment rates**, and **seasonal holidays**—influence total sales and revenue trends over time.

This project demonstrates end-to-end **business intelligence workflows**, from data modeling to insight generation, and is well-suited for data analytics and BI portfolios.

## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations & Analysis

### 🏬 Store Performance

* **Total Sales by Store** bar chart highlights **significant revenue variance** across the 45 stores.
* Identifies high-performing and underperforming locations for benchmarking and strategic planning.

### 🎉 Holiday vs Non-Holiday Impact

* Holiday sales contribute **$0.51B (7.5%)** of total revenue.
* Non-holiday periods dominate sales with **$6.23B (92.5%)**, indicating that Walmart’s revenue is largely driven by **consistent everyday demand** rather than seasonal spikes.

### ⛽ Sales vs Fuel Price

* Time-series analysis (2010–2012) shows **sales fluctuations alongside fuel price volatility**.
* Rising fuel prices introduce variability but do not show a direct proportional decline in sales.

### 📉 Sales vs CPI

* CPI demonstrates a **steady upward trend** over time.
* Sales remain relatively stable despite increasing CPI, suggesting **pricing resilience and demand stability**.

### 🌡️ Temperature Correlation

* Scatter plot visualizes sales density across temperature ranges.
* Indicates **no strong linear relationship**, but highlights operational exposure across diverse climatic conditions.
